appris.principal1.1,APPRIS P1,apprisp1,,,Transcript model containing a protein isoform classified as PRINCIPAL:1 by APPRIS. ,Transcript(s) expected to code for the main functional protein isoform based solely on the core modules in the APPRIS. Multiple PRINCIPAL:1 transcripts can be called in a gene due to alterative splicing within UTRs. ,false,,
appris.principal2.1,APPRIS P2,apprisp2,,,Transcript model containing a protein isoform classified as PRINCIPAL:2 by APPRIS. ,"When the APPRIS modules cannot clearly select a single protein-coding isoform for a PRINCIPAL:1 transcript out of a pool of multiple candidates, a PRINCIPAL:2 model may instead be selected. This is model containing a protein isoform with a raw TRIFID score that is substantially higher than that for all other candidate models. ",false,,
appris.principal3.1,APPRIS P3,apprisp3,,,Transcript model containing a protein isoform classified as PRINCIPAL:3 by APPRIS. ,"When the APPRIS modules cannot clearly select a single protein-coding isoform for a PRINCIPAL:1 or :2 transcript out of a pool of multiple candidates, a PRINCIPAL:3 model may instead be selected. This is model containing a protein isoform that has more proteomics support than other candidates. ",false,,
appris.principal4.1,APPRIS P4,apprisp4,,,Transcript model containing a protein isoform classified as PRINCIPAL:4 by APPRIS. ,"When the APPRIS modules cannot clearly select a single protein-coding isoform for a PRINCIPAL:1, :2 or :3 transcript out of a pool of multiple candidates, a PRINCIPAL:4 model may instead be selected. This is model containing a protein isoform that has the highest raw TRIFID score compared with other candiates. ",false,,
appris.principal5.1,APPRIS P5,apprisp5,,,Transcript model containing a protein isoform classified as PRINCIPAL:5 by APPRIS. ,"When the APPRIS modules cannot clearly select a single protein-coding isoform for a PRINCIPAL:1, :2, :3 or :4 transcript out of a pool of multiple candidates, a PRINCIPAL:5 model may instead be selected. This is model containing a protein isoform that has the longest CDS length compared with other candidates. ",false,,
appris.alternative1.1,APPRIS ALT1,apprisa1,,,Transcript model containing a protein isoform classified as ALT1 by APPRIS. ,"For a gene in which the APPRIS core modules selected a PRINCIPAL:2, :3, :4 or : 5 model, an ALT1 is a candidate transcript model with a protein isoform that is conserved in at least three tested non-primate species.",false,,
appris.alternative2.1,APPRIS ALT2,apprisa2,,,Transcript model containing a protein isoform classified as ALT2 by APPRIS. ,"For genes in which the APPRIS core modules selected a PRINCIPAL:2, :3, :4 or : 5 model, an ALT2 is a candidate transcript model with a protein isoform that is not deemed to be conserved in at least three tested non-primate species.",false,,
